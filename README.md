FOS reviews about FOSS

Add reviews to the relevant section in the Wiki, feel free to edit reviews and make them better but all reviews must be positive towards FOSS (obviously if a FOSS program is bad you can say so). <br>
Hopefully, I will change to CBCMS (https://github.com/codebundle/cbcms) and have my own domain/server and this is where all the files will be hosted (including CMS files).
